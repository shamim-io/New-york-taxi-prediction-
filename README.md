Information on taxis:
Yellow Taxi: Yellow Medallion Taxicabs
These are the famous NYC yellow taxis that provide transportation exclusively through street-hails. The
number of taxicabs is limited by a finite number of medallions issued by the TLC. You access this mode of
transportation by standing in the street and hailing an available taxi with your hand. The pickups are not prearranged.
For Hire Vehicles (FHVs)
FHV transportation is accessed by a pre-arrangement with a dispatcher or limo company. These FHVs are
not permitted to pick up passengers via street hails, as those rides are not considered pre-arranged.
Green Taxi: Street Hail Livery (SHL)
The SHL program will allow livery vehicle owners to license and outfit their vehicles with green borough taxi
branding, meters, credit card machines, and ultimately the right to accept street hails in addition to prearranged rides.
